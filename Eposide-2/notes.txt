NPM not stands for node package manager, but most of the devlopers commuitty calls node package manager, since 
it manages many packages in the background. It is a large repository containing huge no.of packages .
All the packages , libaries, utilites whcih are required for applicaton building are found in NPM.

--package.json is configration for NPM
all the package/dependancies related information  stored in package.json

--bundler package is used to make all the files comprised and ready to ship production 
Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file:

we can install two types of dependancies/pacakges, one is dev dependancies and other one is production used dependancies
so to install dev dependancies we npm install -D --package_name

---Parcel is a build tool for the web that requires little to no configuration. It's used for bundling,
 which is the process of merging imported files into a single file or multiple files

 it creates dev build, local server and it gives HMR(Hot module replacement)


transitive dependancies= if any dependany depends on other dependancies is called dependancies.
eg if parcel dependancy is required for app development then there some dependices exists to run this parcel dependancy,
this dependices exist in node modules.

---No need to move node modules to github or production, using package.json and lock.json we can install all dependancies.
Whatever essintial that needs to moved to github, remanining can be regenerated  using npm install.

--npm used for mangaing packages like install, delete, update
--npx is used for excuting package

--injecting React or react dom for app using CDN is not preferable 
it is a costly operation , CDN links have version , so we need to upadte everytime new React version is came
