--NPM Start or NPM run start both commands/scripts are same that configured with some package and index.html/ any soure file,
in package.json file. Npm start automatically creats dev build and call given source file to run on local dev server

For buliding prod bulid we use build command in between package name and source file.
eg:-
"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "bulid":" parcel build index.html,
    "test": "jest"
  },

--Dom elements are equivalent to HTML elements
--ReactElement is an object when we render this object on DOM , it becomes HTML elements

babel which is part of parcel or any bundeler before sending code  to broswer Engine it is transpiled(coverting broswer understandable langauage) and send to JS Engine of broswer.
// babel is a javascript compiler


--To give name of the class for any elemant in JSX , we have to use className but not class
